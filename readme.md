# DarkWeb 

## Vision Statement

We are working with the community at large to create a simple, easy to use browser plug-in
that anyone can use to reduce eye strain, relieve stress and maintain comfort throughout their day. 


## Outline

Welcome to our project and thanks for dropping in. We are excited you’re here. DarkWeb is a plugin that allows you to seamlessly view content on you browser while controlling the amount of blue/white light that is displayed. Our team’s goal is to create a plugin for anyone who may not want their sleep disrupted or to reduce eye strain. By not using brute force swapping of intensity we allow for a more nuanced approach to interpret the the colors showed on a website.  We allow for a configurable approach so each user can to choose from settings or use a per-selected settings for more control. 

## Status
Project runs and implements basic funtionality.

## Team's feature/accomplishments and next steps
Cameron: Responsible for extension UI look and layout. Artifacts include settings.html and setting.css. Both of these files can be found in DarkWeb/popup.
Next steps: Implementing better color filtering so pages look more uniform when filter is applied.
         
Tyler: Responsible for implementing the basic structure for the project (DarkWeb/manifest.json, DarkWeb/popup/, DarkWeb/icons/), aided in the construction of the background.js file, and created the 'Night' theme. Next steps: Reimplement 'Night' mode feature utilizing JQuery for more nuanced adjustments of web page element colors.

Nicolas:

Rhett: Responsible for adding the RotateCW, RotateCCW, and Blue Light filters. I provided small adjustments to the GUI(Artifacts available in background.js, popup/settings.css, and popup/settings.html in the Darkweb folder of this repository). Background.js is used at all times, settings.css is used when the popup is on, and settings.html is used whenever a buttonID is called for. Also responsible researching how to implement ability to apply to multiple tabs at once, making a filter persist in a tab that is updated, which has proved to be very challenging for our team right now. Status: Continuing work on the incomplete issues mentioned in the last sentence.
