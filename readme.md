# DarkWeb 

## Vision Statement

We are working with the community at large to create a simple, easy to use browser plug-in
that anyone can use to reduce eye strain, relieve stress and maintain comfort throughout their day. 


## Outline

Welcome to our project and thanks for dropping in. We are excited you’re here. DarkWeb is a plugin that allows you to seamlessly view content on you browser while controlling the amount of blue/white light that is displayed. Our team’s goal is to create a plugin for anyone who may not want their sleep disrupted or to reduce eye strain. By not using brute force swapping of intensity we allow for a more nuanced approach to interpret the the colors showed on a website.  We allow for a configurable approach so each user can to choose from settings or use a per-selected settings for more control. 

## Status
Project runs and implements basic funtionality.
