Finished researching basic javascript including the use of color manipulation. 
Seems to be pretty simple to just change the color values of background layers 
and text, though algorithms might be more challenging then I think they will be.

changing colors is as simple as one line,
Ex: "document.body.style.backgroundColor = "#000000";" will change a background black
