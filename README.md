# DarkWeb 

## Vision Statement

Our team is developing DarkWeb as a plugin for anyone who wants more control over how the coloring and brightness of content is displayed in their browser.


## Outline

Welcome to our project and thanks for dropping in. We are excited you’re here. DarkWeb is a plugin that allows you to seamlessly view content on you browser while controlling the amount of blue/white light that is displayed. Our team’s goal is to create plugin for anyone who may not want their sleep disrupted or to reduce eye strain. By not using brute force swapping of intensity we allow for a more nuanced approach to interpret the the colors showed on a website.  We allow for a configurable approach so each user can to choose from settings or use a per-selected settings for more control.
