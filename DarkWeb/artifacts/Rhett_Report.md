(This is to serve as part of my artifact for Sprint 2)

I took the majority of time on this sprint figuring out the
differences between Chrome and Firefox extensions and trying 
search for anything that could be going wrong in the code to 
cause problems with Chrome compatibility. The main issues that
still evade me are the reason as to why filters won't apply correctly
in Chrome, and small white bars that appear on the popup only in chrome.

The filters will just require more time to figure out, but the graphical 
seems to be a result of the transition between Firefox and Chrome. After
no luck fixing it with CSS, I found it talked about on a couple of forums
that only mentioned that it was something inherent to Chrome.

Therefore I feel that my next step might be to rebuild the skeleton of the
extension entirely with Chrome in mind and find a workaround.

Trying to make a single build of the extension to work on both browsers
seems to be a needless limitation and during the next sprint I will create
separate folder in the master branch for a Chrome-founded version.
